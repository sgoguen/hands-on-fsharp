Certainly! F# (pronounced "F sharp") is a functional-first programming language that also supports object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms. It's a member of the ML language family and runs on the .NET platform. Here's an outline of its major features:

1. **Functional Programming (FP) Features**
    - **Immutable Data**: By default, data values in F# are immutable.
    - **First-class Functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and assigned to variables.
    - **Pattern Matching**: Allows for concise and expressive ways to destructure data and handle different cases.
    - **Type Inference**: The compiler can often determine types automatically, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
    - **Tuples and Records**: Grouping of multiple values into single value types.
    - **Discriminated Unions**: Define types that can be one of a set of named cases.
    - **Higher-order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.
    - **Currying**: Breaking down functions that take multiple arguments into a series of functions that take a single argument.
    - **List, Array, and Sequence Comprehensions**: Concise ways to generate and manipulate collections.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Features**
    - **Classes and Objects**: Define and instantiate classes.
    - **Inheritance**: Derive new classes from existing ones.
    - **Interfaces**: Define contracts that classes can implement.
    - **Properties**: Encapsulate data with getters and setters.
    - **Events**: Provide a mechanism to notify other objects of state changes.

3. **Type System**
    - **Strong Typing**: Helps catch errors at compile-time.
    - **Units of Measure**: Attach units to numbers to prevent mixing incompatible units.
    - **Type Providers**: Generate types on-the-fly from external data sources.
    - **Generics**: Define algorithms in a type-agnostic way.

4. **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**
    - **Asynchronous Workflows**: Simplify asynchronous and parallel code.
    - **Mailbox Processors**: Model concurrent systems using the actor model.
    - **Parallel Programming**: Utilize multiple cores for computation.

5. **Interoperability**
    - **.NET Integration**: Use any .NET library and integrate with C# and VB.NET.
    - **P/Invoke**: Call functions in shared dynamic-link libraries.
    - **Type Extensions**: Add methods to existing types without modifying them.

6. **Other Features**
    - **Interactive REPL (F# Interactive)**: Execute F# code interactively.
    - **Computation Expressions**: Define custom computational workflows, like query expressions.
    - **Active Patterns**: Decompose data in custom ways for pattern matching.
    - **Modules**: Organize code without requiring classes.

This is a high-level overview, and there are many more details and nuances to each of these features. If you're interested in diving deeper into any specific feature, let me know!
