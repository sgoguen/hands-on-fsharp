# History of ML Languages

* In 1973, Robin Milner created the ML programming language while working on the LCF theorem prover
* LCF was an early theorem prover and made a big impact on shaping:
    * Modern theorem provers
        * Introduced tactic-driven style for proofs.
        * Foundation for many of today's theorem provers.
    * Emphasis on Soundness
        * Prioritized proof trustworthiness.
        * Small, verifiable core (LCF kernel) ensured fewer errors.
    * ML Programming Language
        * Yielded Type Inference & Hindley-Milner
        * Pioneered polymorphic type inference.
        * No need for explicit type annotations.
        * Gold standard for functional languages.
    *  the fields of theorem proving, functional programming, and practical type theory
* ML was designed to manipulate proofs
* Why does it matter?  Because F# is based on OCaml, which is based on ML
